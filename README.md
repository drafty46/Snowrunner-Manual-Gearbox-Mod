# SnowRunner Manual Gearbox Mod

Disables 'auto' gear shifting in favor of manual shifting through custom keybindings for keyboard and gamepads.

**Currently Logitech Driving Force Shifter and other joystick-type devices are not supported, but I'm working on it.**

## Installation2

1. Get the latest release [here](https://github.com/drafty46/Snowrunner-Manual-Gearbox-Mod/releases)
1. Extract _.dll_ and _.exe_ files from archive into the game folder, where _SnowRunner.exe_ is located
1. Start SnowRunner
1. Run _smgm-loader.exe_ to apply the mod

## Usage

When you use the mod for the first time, it'll create a config file _(smgm.ini)_ near game's main _.exe_ file.
There you can change keybinding for keyboard and for gamepad separately. By default, cycling through gears is done by **LCtrl** and **LAlt** on keyboards, and **DPad Left & Right** on gamepads. Keys are represented by hex values.

You can find all values for keyboard keys in [Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes).

To apply new changes you must restart the mod.

* Press **F1** to detach the mod from the game (you will see `DLL Detach` message in the console)

## Known issues

* Gearbox UI is not updated when you shift gears
* First gear will be labeled as _Low+_ if your truck has that gear
* No engine stalling
* You can use _Diff Lock_ when the truck is on first gear. But only while you hold the in-game key for shifting gears
* Key presses are captured even when game is collapsed
